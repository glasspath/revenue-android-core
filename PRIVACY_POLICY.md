### Introduction

Welcome to Revenue for Android, 

This application is designed primarily to help you track your hours and mileage. To facilitate this functionality, our app may request access to your device's location services. However, it's important to note that our app does not actively or continuously track any sensitive personal data.

The tracking of your location is solely initiated by you, the user. Our application does not autonomously collect or share your location information with any third parties. Your location data is exclusively used within the app for the purpose of recording your hours and mileage, and it remains under your control.

We are committed to safeguarding your privacy, and we respect your autonomy in managing the app's location tracking features. Your location data is not shared or disclosed to any external entities, and we do not use it for any purpose other than the primary function of our app, which is to assist you with hours and mileage tracking.

Our application provides the capability to export contacts and call logs for your convenience, enabling you to manage client information and create invoices. You have full control over this feature, and data is never transferred without your explicit initiation.

If you choose to transfer exported contacts and call logs to our desktop application, please be aware that this process is conducted with your consent and for your exclusive use. The data remains under your control throughout the entire process.

We take data security seriously. All transferred data between the mobile app and the desktop application is encrypted to ensure that your information remains private and protected. This encryption adds an extra layer of security to safeguard your exported data during transit.

Your privacy and the security of your data are our top priorities. We do not share, store, or access your data on our servers or with any third parties. If you have any questions or concerns about how your data is handled, please don't hesitate to contact us for further clarification. We are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of your information.
